== Description ==

<h2>Go Full Width After Switching to Astra</h2>

This plugin essentially helps you make your existing website compatible with Page Builders when you switch to Astra theme. Here is how this plugin works - 

1. Install & Activate the plugin
1. Click on the Link: "Go Fullwidth"
In a moment, the pages & posts where you've used the Page Builder will go fullwidth.

That’s about it. If you’re interested in understanding how this works, read along!

Instead of making all pages and posts go full width, this plugin smartly detects <strong>only</strong> Pages / Posts that are made using Page Builders and only updates them automagically.

This is what happens when you click on "Let's Go Full Width"

1. Layout will be set to "Full Width"
1. Title will be disabled
1. Sidebar will be set to "No Sidebar"
1. Featured Image will be disabled

NOTES: 

1. This plugin is made just for the Astra Theme. It does not work for other themes.
1. Supported Page Builders are: Beaver Builder, Elementor & Visual Composer.
1. IMPORTANT: Please take a backup of your site before using this plugin.

== Installation ==
