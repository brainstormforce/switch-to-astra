== Description ==

This plugin essentially helps you make your existing website compatible with Page Builders when you switch to Astra theme. Here is how this plugin works - 

1. Install & Activate the plugin
1. Click on the Link: "Go Fullwidth"
In a moment, the pages & posts where you've used the Page Builder will go fullwidth.

That’s about it. If you’re interested in understanding how this works, read along!

Instead of making all pages and posts go full width, this plugin smartly detects only those who meet the following criteria:

1. Pages / Posts that are built using Page Builders
1. Astra "Layout Settings" Meta Box values are default as in this <a href="https://cl.ly/mOHJ/170908103330.png">screenshot</a>. 

This is what happens when you click on "Make My Site Page Builder Compatible"

1. Layout will be set to "Full Width"
1. Title will be disabled
1. Sidebar will be set to "No Sidebar"
1. Featured Image will be disabled
